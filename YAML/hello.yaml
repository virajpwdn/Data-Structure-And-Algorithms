# YAML is a data serialization language
# object -> serializer -> converts into streams 
# This Streams of buffer are given to YAML file, database, memory

# Benefits of YAML file
# 1. Easy to write and understand
# 2. Strict typed language
# 3. Many languages supports yml
# 4. Easy to convert in JSON and XML
# 5. More powerful when representating data

# In YAML there are 3 ways to write strings

text: this is a string
data: "This is a string"
type2: 'This is also a string'

# write single line in multiple lines
message: > 
this will all be in one single line

#same as this
message: this will all be in one single line
message: !!str  "this will all be in one single line"
